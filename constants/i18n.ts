    // How It Works Tab - UPDATED CONTENT
    howItWorksTitle: 'How MXI Works',
    howItWorksIntro: '🚀 MXI functions as an expanding ecosystem designed to grow in phases, ensuring that each stage drives the next. Today we are in presale, the earliest and most strategic phase of the project, where the first participants gain early access to the token before its full integration into the system.',
    step1Title: '1️⃣ Early Token Acquisition (Presale)',
    step1Description: 'During this stage, users purchase MAXCoin (MXI) at preferential prices (0.40, 0.70, and 1.00 USDT). These tokens are not released all at once: they enter an automated vesting system that guarantees stability and controlled distribution.',
    step2Title: '2️⃣ Smart Daily Vesting',
    step2Description: 'Acquired tokens are released through a Daily Vesting of 3% monthly, calculated and released minute by minute. This mechanism ensures three things:\n\n• Progressive circulation\n• Market protection\n• Greater price sustainability\n\nIn other words, you receive your tokens constantly and predictably without saturating the supply.',
    step3Title: '3️⃣ Active Ecosystem Under Construction',
    step3Description: 'While users receive MXI, the team develops and integrates core components:\n\n• MXI App: balance management, vesting, expansion network, and internal tools\n• Skill Tournaments: rewards generated by real participation\n• MXI Pay: instant conversion payment system\n• MXI Card: will allow you to use your balance at any compatible merchant\n• Quantum Security: post-quantum algorithms that shield transactions and keys\n\nAll of this is activated in stages as the presale is completed.',
    step4Title: '4️⃣ Market Entry and Expansion Phase',
    step4Description: 'Once the presale ends and the app is in full operation, MXI begins its growth cycle:\n\n• Daily token utility\n• Merchant integration\n• Internal marketplace\n• International expansion\n• Future migration to its own blockchain\n\nThis is key: valuation is driven by use, not speculation.\n\n✨ MXI functions as a living system: it allows you to enter early, receive your token in an orderly manner, and accompany the growth of an ecosystem designed to scale in the coming months.',

Its native token, MAXCoin (MXI), has a limited issuance of 50 million and an economic model based on real utility, daily vesting, and programmed liquidity.',
    whatIsMXIEarlyStage: 'During this early stage, MXI is being structured to become a comprehensive network of payments, rewards, skill tournaments, merchant integration, and a card linked to the MXI wallet, which will allow balances to be used at any time.

    // How It Works Tab - UPDATED CONTENT
    howItWorksTitle: 'Cómo Funciona MXI',
    howItWorksIntro: '🚀 MXI funciona como un ecosistema en expansión diseñado para crecer por fases, asegurando que cada etapa impulse la siguiente. Hoy nos encontramos en preventa, la fase más temprana y estratégica del proyecto, donde los primeros participantes obtienen acceso anticipado al token antes de su integración total en el sistema.',
    step1Title: '1️⃣ Adquisición Temprana del Token (Preventa)',
    step1Description: 'Durante esta etapa, los usuarios compran MAXCoin (MXI) a precios preferenciales (0.40, 0.70 y 1.00 USDT). Estos tokens no se liberan todos de inmediato: entran en un sistema automatizado de vesting que garantiza estabilidad y distribución controlada.',
    step2Title: '2️⃣ Vesting Diario Inteligente',
    step2Description: 'Los tokens adquiridos se liberan mediante un Vesting Diario del 3% mensual, calculado y liberado minuto a minuto. Este mecanismo asegura tres cosas:\n\n• Circulación progresiva\n• Protección del mercado\n• Mayor sostenibilidad del precio\n\nEn otras palabras, recibes tus tokens de forma constante y predecible sin saturar la oferta.',
    step3Title: '3️⃣ Ecosistema en Construcción Activa',
    step3Description: 'Mientras los usuarios reciben MXI, el equipo desarrolla e integra los componentes centrales:\n\n• MXI App: gestión de saldos, vesting, red de expansión y herramientas internas\n• Torneos de habilidad: recompensas generadas por participación real\n• MXI Pay: sistema de pagos con conversión instantánea\n• Tarjeta MXI: que te permitirá usar tu saldo en cualquier comercio compatible\n• Seguridad Cuántica: algoritmos post-cuánticos que blindan transacciones y claves\n\nTodo esto se activa por etapas conforme se completa la preventa.',
    step4Title: '4️⃣ Entrada a Mercado y Fase de Expansión',
    step4Description: 'Una vez la preventa finalice y la app esté en operación completa, MXI inicia su ciclo de crecimiento:\n\n• Utilidad diaria del token\n• Integración con comercios\n• Marketplace interno\n• Expansión internacional\n• Futura migración a su propio blockchain\n\nEsto es clave: la valorización se impulsa por uso, no por especulación.\n\n✨ MXI funciona como un sistema vivo: te permite entrar temprano, recibir tu token de forma ordenada y acompañar el crecimiento de un ecosistema diseñado para escalar en los próximos meses.',

    // How It Works Tab - UPDATED CONTENT
    howItWorksTitle: 'Como o MXI Funciona',
    howItWorksIntro: '🚀 O MXI funciona como um ecossistema em expansão projetado para crescer em fases, garantindo que cada etapa impulsione a próxima. Hoje estamos em pré-venda, a fase mais inicial e estratégica do projeto, onde os primeiros participantes obtêm acesso antecipado ao token antes de sua integração total no sistema.',
    step1Title: '1️⃣ Aquisição Antecipada do Token (Pré-venda)',
    step1Description: 'Durante esta etapa, os usuários compram MAXCoin (MXI) a preços preferenciais (0.40, 0.70 e 1.00 USDT). Esses tokens não são liberados todos de uma vez: eles entram em um sistema automatizado de vesting que garante estabilidade e distribuição controlada.',
    step2Title: '2️⃣ Vesting Diário Inteligente',
    step2Description: 'Os tokens adquiridos são liberados através de um Vesting Diário de 3% mensal, calculado e liberado minuto a minuto. Este mecanismo garante três coisas:\n\n• Circulação progressiva\n• Proteção do mercado\n• Maior sustentabilidade do preço\n\nEm outras palavras, você recebe seus tokens de forma constante e previsível sem saturar a oferta.',
    step3Title: '3️⃣ Ecossistema em Construção Ativa',
    step3Description: 'Enquanto os usuários recebem MXI, a equipe desenvolve e integra os componentes centrais:\n\n• MXI App: gestão de saldos, vesting, rede de expansão e ferramentas internas\n• Torneios de habilidade: recompensas geradas por participação real\n• MXI Pay: sistema de pagamentos com conversão instantânea\n• Cartão MXI: que permitirá usar seu saldo em qualquer comerciante compatível\n• Segurança Quântica: algoritmos pós-quânticos que protegem transações e chaves\n\nTudo isso é ativado em etapas conforme a pré-venda é concluída.',
    step4Title: '4️⃣ Entrada no Mercado e Fase de Expansão',
    step4Description: 'Uma vez que a pré-venda termine e o app esteja em operação completa, o MXI inicia seu ciclo de crescimento:\n\n• Utilidade diária do token\n• Integração com comerciantes\n• Marketplace interno\n• Expansão internacional\n• Futura migração para seu próprio blockchain\n\nIsso é fundamental: a valorização é impulsionada pelo uso, não pela especulação.\n\n✨ O MXI funciona como um sistema vivo: permite que você entre cedo, receba seu token de forma ordenada e acompanhe o crescimento de um ecossistema projetado para escalar nos próximos meses.',

O projeto também incorpora um sistema de segurança quântica voltado para proteger transações e chaves contra tecnologias emergentes, garantindo um ecossistema preparado para o futuro.',
    whatIsMXIPresale: '💎 Na pré-venda, o MXI oferece acesso a preços iniciais inferiores ao valor projetado do token uma vez que as funções principais do ecossistema sejam ativadas.
