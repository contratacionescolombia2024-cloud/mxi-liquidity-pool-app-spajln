    // Sustainability Tab Content - NEW CONTENT
    sustainabilityIntro: '💎 MXI is sustainable in the long term because its economic model is based on real utility, organic growth, and community participation. Unlike speculative projects, MXI incorporates services that generate constant token movement: payments, marketplace, loans, staking, card, tools for entrepreneurs, and shared value programs. Each service feeds the ecosystem, avoiding dependence on new buyers to sustain the economy.',
    sustainabilityDecentralized: '🌍 Additionally, the decentralized approach allows the community to drive key decisions, creating an adaptable, self-sufficient system resistant to external crises. The adoption of advanced technologies such as quantum security, the modularity of its architecture, and the focus on real economy ensure that MXI evolves, expands, and remains relevant for the coming decades.',

    // Daily Vesting Tab Content - NEW KEYS
    vestingDiarioIntro: 'Daily vesting is a mechanism designed to protect the project&apos;s stability during the presale and, at the same time, provide investors with a fair, predictable, and sustainable way to receive their tokens. Instead of releasing all tokens immediately—which usually generates drastic drops due to massive sales—MXI distributes allocations progressively, balanced, and transparently.',
    vestingDiarioProcess: 'From the moment a user acquires MXI in presale, their total balance is recorded in a smart contract that manages daily release. Every 24 hours, a predefined percentage of the total purchased is released automatically, allowing the user to withdraw it, transfer it, or use it within the ecosystem.',
    vestingDiarioGuarantees: 'This process guarantees that all participants have gradual access to their tokens without saturating the market, while the project advances in development, user growth, financial services integration, and ecosystem expansion. The goal is to create a natural balance between supply and demand, which strengthens the token&apos;s valuation and benefits early investors with a sustainable model.',
    vestingDiarioTransparency: 'Additionally, daily vesting is part of MXI&apos;s commitment to transparency: each release can be audited on the blockchain, and users maintain total control over their token flow without depending on intermediaries.',
    vestingDiarioSummaryTitle: 'In summary, daily vesting is a tool designed to:',
    vestingDiarioPoint1: 'Protect the token&apos;s value and avoid abrupt drops.',
    vestingDiarioPoint2: 'Accompany the real growth of the ecosystem.',
    vestingDiarioPoint3: 'Create equality among investors in the initial stage.',
    vestingDiarioPoint4: 'Guarantee traceability and security in each release.',
    vestingDiarioPoint5: 'Offer progressive liquidity without compromising sustainability.',
    vestingDiarioConclusion: 'With this model, MXI builds a responsible and future-oriented scenario, where each community member receives their share in a balanced way, while the project develops the foundations of a real decentralized economy.',
    
    // Risks Tab Content - NEW KEYS
    risksIntro: 'Investing in MXI represents an innovative opportunity within an ecosystem designed for real growth, but it also involves inherent risks that every investor should consider responsibly. MXI promotes transparency, so we detail the key factors that can influence the present and future profitability of the project.',
    risk1Title: '1. Market Volatility Risk',
    risk1Desc1: 'The crypto market is highly volatile. Although MXI integrates a hybrid tokenomic model that seeks stability through daily vesting, liquidity mechanisms, and scalable rewards, the price can fluctuate significantly due to global conditions, market sentiment, or unexpected events.',
    risk1Desc2: 'The projected launch value (3 USDT) is an estimate, not a guarantee.',
    risk2Title: '2. Technological Risk',
    risk2Desc1: 'Despite MXI incorporating post-quantum security and advanced architecture, no digital ecosystem is completely free of vulnerabilities. Protocol failures, external attacks, or new technological threats could affect operability.',
    risk2Desc2: 'Quantum implementation minimizes future scenarios, but does not eliminate risks 100%.',
    risk3Title: '3. Project Execution Risk',
    risk3Desc: 'MXI is in the presale phase and, like any project in development, depends on the correct execution of the technical plan, implementation timelines, community adoption, and consolidation of strategic alliances. Delays or restructurings may impact goals and projections.',
    risk4Title: '4. Regulatory Risk',
    risk4Desc: 'The global regulatory environment regarding crypto assets is changing. Changes in laws of key countries, greater compliance requirements, or restrictions on exchanges may influence the liquidity, accessibility, or price of the token.',
    risk5Title: '5. Liquidity Risk',
    risk5Desc: 'Although MXI integrates a progressive liquidity model and tools that incentivize holding (daily vesting, rewards, referrals), in initial stages liquidity may be limited. This could make immediate sales at desired prices difficult.',
    risk6Title: '6. Ecosystem Adoption Risk',
    risk6Desc1: 'MXI&apos;s potential grows as the community strengthens and use within the ecosystem increases (card, credits, tools for entrepreneurs, marketplaces, Launchpad, energy, global expansion, etc.).',
    risk6Desc2: 'Slower adoption could prolong token appreciation timelines.',
    risk7Title: '7. Competitive Risk',
    risk7Desc: 'MXI competes in a market where highly positioned projects exist (BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA). Although the hybrid model, dynamic vesting, and quantum security represent differential advantages, competitor advances could affect potential market share.',
    risk8Title: '8. Community Dependency Risk',
    risk8Desc1: 'MXI is based on a fundamental principle: if the community grows, everyone grows.',
    risk8Desc2: 'This means that part of the success depends on the participation, commitment, and expansion of users, project issuers, entrepreneurs, and investors. Low participation would limit global projections.',
    risk9Title: '9. Early Investment Risk',
    risk9Desc: 'As in any presale, investors acquire the token before the ecosystem is fully deployed. Although this offers price advantages (0.04 / 0.07 / 0.10 USDT), it also carries the natural uncertainty of initial stages.',

    metaTitle: 'Our Goal',
    metaIntro: '🎯 Our goal is to build a real, decentralized, and sustainable economy, designed to free people and businesses from dependence on the traditional financial system. Our purpose is simple but powerful: to create an ecosystem where growth is driven by the community, not by central institutions, focused primarily on the Latin American public, their needs and strengths.',
    metaVision: '💎 MXI is born with a clear vision: to democratize economic opportunities. That is why our ecosystem will integrate real solutions such as peer-to-peer lending systems, direct support for entrepreneurs, tools for investors, and liquidity mechanisms that favor community development. When the community grows, MXI grows; and when MXI advances, everyone wins.',
    metaModel: '🔗 We seek to build an economic model in which value is not controlled by a few, but distributed among those who actively participate. Our approach combines advanced blockchain technology, next-generation quantum security, and an infrastructure designed to scale globally, creating a secure, transparent environment prepared for the challenges of the future.',
    metaObjective: '🚀 The ultimate goal is to consolidate MXI as a development engine:',
    metaObjectivePoint1: '• A real bridge for entrepreneurs who need financing',
    metaObjectivePoint2: '• A solid alternative for investors seeking decentralized growth',

    howItWorksTitle: 'How MXI Works',
    howItWorksIntro: '🚀 MXI functions as an expanding ecosystem designed to grow in phases, ensuring that each stage drives the next. Today we are in presale, the earliest and most strategic phase of the project, where the first participants gain early access to the token before its full integration into the system.',
    step1Title: '1️⃣ Early Token Acquisition (Presale)',
    step1Description: 'During this stage, users purchase MAXCoin (MXI) at preferential prices (0.40, 0.70, and 1.00 USDT). These tokens are not released all at once: they enter an automated vesting system that guarantees stability and controlled distribution.',
    step2Title: '2️⃣ Smart Daily Vesting',
    step2Description: 'Acquired tokens are released through a Daily Vesting of 3% monthly, calculated and released minute by minute. This mechanism ensures three things:\n\n• Progressive circulation\n• Market protection\n• Greater price sustainability\n\nIn other words, you receive your tokens constantly and predictably without saturating the supply.',
    step3Title: '3️⃣ Active Ecosystem Under Construction',
    step3Description: 'While users receive MXI, the team develops and integrates core components:\n\n• MXI App: balance management, vesting, expansion network, and internal tools\n• Skill Tournaments: rewards generated by real participation\n• MXI Pay: instant conversion payment system\n• MXI Card: will allow you to use your balance at any compatible merchant\n• Quantum Security: post-quantum algorithms that shield transactions and keys\n\nAll of this is activated in stages as the presale is completed.',
    step4Title: '4️⃣ Market Entry and Expansion Phase',
    step4Description: 'Once the presale ends and the app is in full operation, MXI begins its growth cycle:\n\n• Daily token utility\n• Merchant integration\n• Internal marketplace\n• International expansion\n• Future migration to its own blockchain\n\nThis is key: valuation is driven by use, not speculation.\n\n✨ MXI functions as a living system: it allows you to enter early, receive your token in an orderly manner, and accompany the growth of an ecosystem designed to scale in the coming months.',

    whatIsMXIIntro: 'MXI is a crypto-technological project under construction, currently in its strategic pre-launch phase, allowing early participants to access an ecosystem designed to expand rapidly in the coming months. Its native token, MAXCoin (MXI), has a limited issuance of 50 million and an economic model based on real utility, daily vesting, and programmed liquidity.',
    whatIsMXIEarlyStage: 'During this early stage, MXI is being structured to become a comprehensive network of payments, rewards, skill tournaments, merchant integration, and a card linked to the MXI wallet, which will allow balances to be used at any time. The project also incorporates a quantum security system aimed at protecting transactions and keys against emerging technologies, ensuring an ecosystem prepared for the future.',
    whatIsMXIPresale: 'In presale, MXI offers access to initial prices lower than the projected value of the token once the main functions of the ecosystem are activated. This is the phase where the foundation is built: community, initial liquidity, internal mechanisms, and progressive connection with the project tools.',

    risksIntro: 'Investir em MXI representa uma oportunidade inovadora dentro de um ecossistema projetado para o crescimento real, mas também envolve riscos inerentes que todo investidor deve considerar de forma responsável. MXI promove a transparência, por isso detalhamos os fatores-chave que podem influenciar a rentabilidade presente e futura do projeto.',
    risk1Title: '1. Risco de Volatilidade do Mercado',
    risk1Desc1: 'O mercado cripto é altamente volátil. Embora a MXI integre um modelo tokenômico híbrido que busca estabilidade através de vesting diário, mecanismos de liquidez e recompensas escaláveis, o preço pode flutuar significativamente diante de condições globais, sentimento do mercado ou eventos inesperados.',
    risk1Desc2: 'O valor projetado de lançamento (3 USDT) é uma estimativa, não uma garantia.',
    risk2Title: '2. Risco Tecnológico',
    risk2Desc1: 'Apesar de a MXI incorporar segurança quântica pós-quântica e arquitetura avançada, nenhum ecossistema digital está completamente livre de vulnerabilidades. Falhas em protocolos, ataques externos ou novas ameaças tecnológicas poderiam afetar a operabilidade.',
    risk2Desc2: 'A implementação quântica minimiza cenários futuros, mas não elimina os riscos 100%.',
    risk3Title: '3. Risco de Execução do Projeto',
    risk3Desc: 'MXI está em fase de pré-venda e, como todo projeto em desenvolvimento, depende da correta execução do plano técnico, dos prazos de implementação, da adoção comunitária e da consolidação de alianças estratégicas. Atrasos ou reestruturações podem impactar metas e projeções.',
    risk4Title: '4. Risco Regulatório',
    risk4Desc: 'O ambiente regulatório global em relação aos criptoativos está mudando. Mudanças nas leis de países-chave, maiores exigências de conformidade ou restrições a exchanges podem influenciar a liquidez, acessibilidade ou preço do token.',
    risk5Title: '5. Risco de Liquidez',
    risk5Desc: 'Embora a MXI integre um modelo de liquidez progressivo e ferramentas que incentivam o holding (vesting diário, recompensas, referidos), nas fases iniciais a liquidez pode ser limitada. Isso poderia dificultar vendas imediatas ao preço desejado.',
    risk6Title: '6. Risco de Adoção do Ecossistema',
    risk6Desc1: 'O potencial da MXI cresce à medida que a comunidade se fortalece e aumenta o uso dentro do ecossistema (cartão, créditos, ferramentas para empreendedores, marketplaces, Launchpad, energia, expansão global, etc.).',
    risk6Desc2: 'Uma adoção mais lenta poderia prolongar os tempos de apreciação do token.',
    risk7Title: '7. Risco Competitivo',
    risk7Desc: 'MXI compete em um mercado onde existem projetos altamente posicionados (BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA). Embora o modelo híbrido, o vesting dinâmico e a segurança quântica representem vantagens diferenciais, avanços de concorrentes poderiam afetar a cota de mercado potencial.',
    risk8Title: '8. Risco de Dependência Comunitária',
    risk8Desc1: 'MXI se baseia em um princípio fundamental: se a comunidade cresce, todos crescem.',
    risk8Desc2: 'Isso significa que parte do sucesso depende da participação, compromisso e expansão de usuários, emissores de projetos, empreendedores e investidores. A baixa participação limitaria as projeções globais.',
    risk9Title: '9. Risco de Investimento Inicial',
    risk9Desc: 'Como em toda pré-venda, os investidores adquirem o token antes que o ecossistema esteja completamente implantado. Embora isso ofereça vantagens de preço (0.04 / 0.07 / 0.10 USDT), também traz a incerteza natural das fases iniciais.',

    // Daily Vesting Tab Content - NEW KEYS
    vestingDiarioIntro: 'O vesting diário é um mecanismo projetado para proteger a estabilidade do projeto durante a pré-venda e, ao mesmo tempo, fornecer aos investidores uma forma justa, previsível e sustentável de receber seus tokens. Em vez de liberar todos os tokens imediatamente—o que geralmente gera quedas drásticas devido a vendas massivas—MXI distribui as alocações de forma progressiva, equilibrada e transparente.',
    vestingDiarioProcess: 'Desde o momento em que um usuário adquire MXI na pré-venda, seu saldo total é registrado em um contrato inteligente que gerencia a liberação diária. A cada 24 horas, uma porcentagem predefinida do total comprado é liberada automaticamente, permitindo ao usuário retirá-la, transferi-la ou usá-la dentro do ecossistema.',
    vestingDiarioGuarantees: 'Este processo garante que todos os participantes tenham acesso gradual aos seus tokens sem saturar o mercado, enquanto o projeto avança em desenvolvimento, crescimento de usuários, integração de serviços financeiros e expansão do ecossistema. O objetivo é criar um equilíbrio natural entre oferta e demanda, o que fortalece a valorização do token e beneficia os primeiros investidores com um modelo sustentável.',
    vestingDiarioTransparency: 'Além disso, o vesting diário faz parte do compromisso da MXI com a transparência: cada liberação pode ser auditada na blockchain, e os usuários mantêm controle total sobre seu fluxo de tokens sem depender de intermediários.',
    vestingDiarioSummaryTitle: 'Em resumo, o vesting diário é uma ferramenta projetada para:',
    vestingDiarioPoint1: 'Proteger o valor do token e evitar quedas abruptas.',
    vestingDiarioPoint2: 'Acompanhar o crescimento real do ecossistema.',
    vestingDiarioPoint3: 'Criar igualdade entre os investidores na fase inicial.',
    vestingDiarioPoint4: 'Garantir rastreabilidade e segurança em cada liberação.',
    vestingDiarioPoint5: 'Oferecer liquidez progressiva sem comprometer a sustentabilidade.',
